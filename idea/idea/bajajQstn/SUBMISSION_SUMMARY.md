## 📊 SQL Solution Details

The SQL query solves the problem of finding the highest salary that was NOT credited on the 1st day of any month:

```sql
SELECT 
    p.AMOUNT AS SALARY,
    CONCAT(e.FIRST_NAME, ' ', e.LAST_NAME) AS NAME,
    TIMESTAMPDIFF(YEAR, e.DOB, CURDATE()) AS AGE,
    d.DEPARTMENT_NAME
FROM PAYMENTS p
JOIN EMPLOYEE e ON p.EMP_ID = e.EMP_ID
JOIN DEPARTMENT d ON e.DEPARTMENT = d.DEPARTMENT_ID
WHERE DAY(p.PAYMENT_TIME) != 1
ORDER BY p.AMOUNT DESC
LIMIT 1
```
